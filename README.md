# Code Challenge Version 2

This is a WordPress project built with Gulp, Sass and Docker, to run it please follow these instructions.

## Run docker container

To run a WordPress environment first you have to run the Docker containers but i made a YML file to make easy for you. Just copy the **docker-compose.yml** file inside the directory that you want to separate the Docker files, the WordPress project will be in different directory next to the Docker directory.

Please build it via Docker Compose following the next command.
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

After that, just you have to import the SQL backup via PHPMyAdmin, here is the URLs:

```bash
WordPress -->  localhost:8080
PHPMyAdmin --> localhost:8008
```

## Dependencies installation

Please install all depencies via NPM.
```bash
npm install
```

## Finally

The final step, just run Gulp to execute all tasks that you need to compile JS, Sass and Imagemin, this compile every change that you will make in PHP, Sass or JS files.

```bash
gulp
```
